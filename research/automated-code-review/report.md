# Automated code review

*Draft 1, 2026-10-31.*

*Sweep 2026-11-02: ultrareview description (§2.6), ORION, Macroscope Terra note. Eval-baseline arm rejected 2026-11-06.*

Status: first draft, written to be revised once Matt's prior docs are folded in further. Every
external source below was opened on 2026-10-31, except the 2026-11-02 sweep items named above,
CR-Bench-v2 (opened in the 2026-11-04 daily sweep and again on 2026-11-05), and Foresight-SWE
(opened 2026-11-05); anything that could not be opened is listed in "Not verified". Numbers from
different benchmarks are not comparable.

**Precedence for Matt's figures** (as instructed): the 2026-10-31 escapes-dev run beats Phase 0
`RESULTS.md` (2026-10-29), which beats the working notes on overlapping figures; where the notes
are newer than RESULTS (sections e6–e10, 2026-10-31), the notes win.

Tags: **[Matt]** = Matt's prior work (limitless repo or attached docs), **[PR]** peer-reviewed,

## 0. Where accelerate starts

- **There is no code-review skill in accelerate yet.** The repo (`MattFlower/accelerate@15bda99`)
  has one skill, `skills/human-review/`, which turns a change into an HTML review page for a
  person; it is not a defect finder. No issues or PRs exist; no prior code-review, eval or backlog
  docs are in the repo.
- Conventions a new skill should follow, from `human-review`: self-contained skill folder
  (`SKILL.md`, `scripts/`, `references/`), zero-dependency Bun/Node CLI, code on the page comes
  from git not the model, a "precision check" that re-opens every cited line, private output under
  `<repo>/.<skill>/`, and a "feedback → agent" loop. Plugin manifest `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`
  loads `./skills/`, so a new skill is invoked as `/accelerate:<name>`.
- `human-review/SKILL.md` says "in one production study, about one in five AI review comments made
  claims the diff didn't support" without a citation. I couldn't trace it to a source; it should
  get one or be reworded.

## 1. Matt's prior work is the main evidence base [Matt]

Limitless (a software factory) has run a measured, pre-registered review-improvement program
since 2026-09-28. Its datasets, labelling rules and results outrank anything generic here,
because they were measured on real escaped defects in a TypeScript repo with the same two CLIs
(Claude Code, Codex) this skill must run in.

### 1.1 What limitless's docs and evals contain

- `L/docs/research/08-code-review.md` (2026-09-28): literature + industry survey, Limitless's own
  outcome data (54 escaped defects; recall, not pickiness, is the problem), the M4.5 design.
- `L/docs/research/14-review-strength.md` (2026-10-14, appendices to 10-31): error analysis of the
  30 production misses, a literature scan by lever, pre-registered proposals A1–A8, lab-prompt
  variants (App. C) and severity calibration (App. D).
- `L/docs/EVALS.md`: harness design — evaluate in our own harness, deterministic graders,
  contamination-proof standalone checkouts and *snapshot mode*, Wilson intervals, paired
  bootstrap, `eval regrade`/`resume`, escape-case generation.
- `L/evals/review/cases.json` (243 cases: 198 real, 45 clean; splits dev 49, heldout 33,
  escapes-dev 51, escapes-heldout 57, 53 unsplit) and `L/evals/review/LABELS.md` (every
  pre-registered labelling rule, audit and outcome), plus `TRACE.md` / `trace-*.json` (variant E).
- `L/src/evals/judge.ts` (two-judge semantic matcher, landed as PR #1059) and
  `L/src/pipeline/prompts.ts` (the standard / adversarial / careful / trace / probe prompts).

### 1.2 Findings Matt has already established (use these; don't re-research them)

**Measurement**
- **The ±5-line location grader is noisy both ways:** about 20% of its credits were a different
  defect nearby and about 4% of misses were the same defect elsewhere (caller, root cause, just past
  ±5). It is not mainly biased toward conservative systems (Notes, 10-29 credited audit; RESULTS).
- **Two blind text judges from different vendors, one-to-one SAME matching, "both must match"**,
  with a code-reading tiebreak on contested items: judges agreed with hand audits ~94% (Terra 94.1%,
  n=388; Claude 93.5%, n=339) and with each other 97.4%; judge errors cluster below confidence 0.7;
  on 55 contested items "both judges" matched code reading 45 times vs 40/35 for one judge alone
  (RESULTS). Implemented as `L/src/evals/judge.ts`; `JUDGE_RULE` defines SAME as the same failure
  mechanism, at any location, ignoring severity. The Phase 0 Python scripts named in RESULTS
  (`judge_prompt.py`, `validate_judges.py`, `rescore.py`, …) live in Matt's orchestrator workspace,
  not in the repo; `judge.ts` is the in-repo port.
- **"Clean" cases are often not clean.** Audits found real ≥medium defects in 6 of 19 M4.5 clean
  PRs and in 12 of 17 #235 "false blocks" (Report); all three M5.2 held-out clean cases
  (review-068, 092, 108) were defective, confirmed by both vendors with reproductions
  (`L/evals/review/LABELS.md`, held-out clean-case audit 2026-10-30). review-068's skipped-test
  defect was later fixed by #647 after causing ~20 of 49 needs_human runs (Rubric). Clean controls
  need blind two-vendor vetting, not just "no later fix".
- **A clean set of 8 trials can't bound false blocks** (95% upper bound on a block-rate rise ≈37.5%);
  +10 points at 80% power needs ~160–200 gold defects at k=2 or ~110–130 at k=4; same-system runs
  differ 8–10 points (Plan; Report, citing Miller 2024 and Bowyer et al. 2025).
- **Pool gold is biased** toward arms that report more distinct defects, because pooled defects
  come from those arms' own findings (RESULTS, Phase 1 rescore caveat).
- **Gold comes from a procedure, not a better model:** the orchestrator writes a 1.5–2 KB
  PR-specific brief (requirements as checkable claims, every caller that must adopt a check, test
  inputs, targeted questions), runs it on Sol@high with write access for failing tests, then runs a
  mutation check (revert the source diff; the PR's tests must fail) (Report; Notes).

**Reviewer results** (judged recall = two-judge matcher, blocking findings only)

| Arm | Escapes-dev 10-31 (80 defects, k=2) | Phase 0 dev (old gold) | Held-out (Phase 0) | Clean blocks |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| production sol-6.1@medium, standard | **16.9%** (27/160) | 31.6% | 18.6% | 2/32 dev (Notes e7); 2/20 true held-out |
| sol-6.1@high | **30.6%** (+13.8) | 41.8% (+10.2) | not run | 3/8 dev (Phase 0) |

⚠️ **[VB]** vendor benchmark. External corroboration of the Terra cost lever (terra-6.1 rows
above) only: Macroscope posted on 2026-10-31 that GPT 6.1 Terra debuted #2 on their code review
benchmark, 1.6 F1 points behind Opus 5.5 at max effort for 1/20th the cost per review, and at
medium effort beat GPT 6.1 Sol at max for a third of the price
([post](https://x.com/Macroscope/status/2116607601266049434)).

Evals: escapes-dev main `eval-mvw0y6v31sec2vc1agx2t1`, cheap `eval-mvvv3pum0kriw040gi0x29`;
clean-block arms in Notes e7–e10 (`eval-mvwk3pn5…`, `eval-mvwniug6…`, `eval-mvwnjdnp…`,
`eval-mvx3koae1kebh1d07r3w9f`). Gains replicate on defects nobody tuned against; ranking holds
(D > sol@high ≈ E3). False blocks on escape cases are unmeasured (all escape cases are real);
held-out (escapes-heldout, 57 cases / 103 defects) hasn't been run (Escapes-dev).

**Arms that underperformed** (RESULTS, Phase 0 judged / Phase 1 pool-gold combined, vs production)
- Trace finder E (second agent searching callers/entry points): +1.1 / +3.4.
- Probe + setup (reproduce or demote): −9.2 / −6.4 — execution used as a *filter* cut recall.
- Opus as the sole reviewer: −21 / −17 (opus, opus@high) on dev; −9.3 / −6.9 combined. Opus as an
  *extra union finder* adds about +5–9 (Sol 30.6% → ∪ Opus blocking 35.7% → ∪ Opus any severity 39.8%).
- Causal-attribution verifier: null (#235). Cross-vendor verifier: no change; M4.5 panel verifier
  confirms ~94% of candidates, so it doesn't discriminate; the M4.5 panel gave +16 points recall
  at 3.5× false blocks (Notes).
- **Agreement-gated blocking ("block only when both D samples agree") replayed at ~0–1% recall**,
  because the ±5-line merge almost never records agreement; it needs semantic dedupe first (RESULTS 0c).
- **Severity calibration by prompt wording is a null:** five finder-prompt variants all landed at
  6–9/32 clean blocks; the calibrated prompt changed *which* clean cases block, partly by misapplying
  the "explicit requirement" exception to an issue's Out-of-scope list (Notes e10).
- **Clean-case blocks are mostly real-but-minor claims:** a blind two-vendor audit found 20 of 22
  distinct blocking claims true; Opus rated all minor, Sol rated 8 major (Notes e8;
  `L/docs/research/14-review-strength.md` App. C). Severity, more than detection, separates these
  blocks from gold.
- **LLM severity raters don't transfer without a tuned rubric:** v2 raters agreed with Matt's blind
  validation 13/20 (65%), every miss calling a harmless effect "wrong" or a contrived trigger
  plausible; v3 (adds a "nuisance" consequence and a harm threshold) reached 18/20 on a fresh 20 and
  was adopted, with splits going to a human ruling (Notes e2).
- **Checklist F tension (unresolved, for Matt):** the AGENTS.md per-item checklist scored +14.6
  judged on its own 33-case cohort (19/48 vs 12/48), yet the Plan's Don'ts list "long pattern
  checklists" (the Report cites Anthropic's Defending Code harness: "goal plus context" works
  better than long checklists). I have not resolved this.

**Where the reviewer misses** (`L/docs/research/14-review-strength.md` §2; production sol@medium, dev)
- Of 30 misses: 13 needed files outside the diff, 9 needed running code with an adversarial input,
  7 were visible in the diff, 1 needed a project convention. 18 of the 30 were found by no system.
- By category: security 0/12 defect-trials, spec-mismatch 0/6, privacy 9/30.
- Sol stops early: 1.1 findings per eval trial using ~2 of 20 minutes; 0.57 findings per production
  review across 299 reviews. Opus files findings but rates them minor (Report).
- 22 of the 30 misses match a recurring-defect pattern the repo already lists (canonicalize then
  check 8, redaction order 7, one guard every path 5, compatibility 4, trust 2, check-then-act 2,
  derive state 2).
- The Rubric's pilot: redaction gaps with an unusual trigger were 5 of 47 findings.

## 2. External evidence, by theme

Only items I opened. Where Matt's docs already cite an item, it's marked "(in Matt's docs)".

### 2.1 Context: out-of-diff bugs are the hard ones

- **CRBugBench** [arXiv 2610.13668](https://arxiv.org/abs/2610.13668): agents differ in persistence —
  half of gpt-5.6-sol runs end by turn 17 vs turn 35 for opus-5; Opus executes code in 9.7% of turns,
  Sol 6.9%; agents trust misleading PR descriptions and miss repository-wide behaviour. (in Matt's docs)
- **SWE-PRBench** [arXiv 2603.26130](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.26130): 350 PRs; 8 frontier models
  catch 15–31% of human-flagged issues diff-only, and all 8 *degrade* as more file/repo context is
  stuffed into the prompt; a 2,000-token structured diff+summary beat a 2,500-token full-context
  prompt. Judge κ=0.75. (in Matt's docs)
- **OpenAI Codex reviewer** [alignment.openai.com](https://alignment.openai.com/scaling-code-verification/):
  repo-wide tools and execution improved both recall and precision over diff-only GPT-5; precision
  is prioritised for adoption; authors change code for 52.7% of comments. (in Matt's docs)
- **Cursor Bugbot** [cursor.com/blog/building-bugbot](https://cursor.com/blog/building-bugbot): the
  biggest gain came from going fully agentic (the model pulls its own context); the agent was then
  *too cautious*, so prompts were made aggressive; bugs/run 0.4 → 0.7, resolution rate 52% → 70%+.
  (in Matt's docs)

### 2.2 Find wide, filter separately; union, don't vote

- **SWR-Bench** [arXiv 2509.01494](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01494): 1,000 verified PRs; LLM-based
  coverage judge ~90% agreement with humans; a simple multi-review aggregation raised F1 by up to
  43.67%. (in Matt's docs)
- **c-CRAB** [arXiv 2603.23448](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.23448): review comments graded by tests that
  fail at head; union of tools beats the best single tool (figures in Matt's research/08). (in Matt's docs)
- **Bugbot v1** used 8 passes with randomized diff order + majority vote + validator; v2 dropped the
  fixed pipeline for an agent (same Cursor post). Majority vote is in Matt's Don'ts.
- **Beyond Consensus** [arXiv 2510.11822](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11822): LLM validators accept valid
  items readily but reject few invalid ones; consensus made it worse (per Matt's Report). (in Matt's docs)
- **Witnesses discriminate:** CMU/SEI static-alert adjudication [arXiv 2607.09979](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.09979)
  (no false positive produced a valid trigger; 60% of true positives did, per Report). (in Matt's docs)
- ⚠️ **[X]** practitioners converge on the same shape: one reports 73% false positives across 344
  hand-checked findings until "a second adversarial pass tries to kill it first"
  ([post](https://x.com/_alphashark_/status/2097274562077508040)); another requires a failing test
  before a bug claim ([post](https://x.com/terminalxw/status/2097213279240413198)). Anecdotes;
  note the second conflicts with Matt's "no reproduce-or-drop" finding.

### 2.3 Severity, caps and what developers act on

- **Anthropic Code Review** [blog](https://claude.com/blog/code-review), [docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/code-review):
  find (parallel agents) → verify → dedupe and rank → post; three severities: 🔴 Important (fix before
  merge), 🟡 Nit, 🟣 Pre-existing ([severity docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/code-review-pull-requests.md));
  substantive comments on 54% of PRs vs 16% before; "less than 1% of findings are marked incorrect";
  84% of >1,000-line PRs get findings (avg 7.5) vs 31% of <50-line PRs (avg 0.5); agents scale
  with PR size; `REVIEW.md` is read from the base branch, never from the PR
  ([customize](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/code-review-customize.md)). Vendor-reported. (partly in Matt's docs)
- **Codex review rubric** ([`codex-rs/prompts/templates/review/rubric.md`](https://github.com/openai/codex/blob/main/codex-rs/prompts/templates/review/rubric.md)):
  flag only bugs introduced by the commit that the author would fix; "do not stop at the first
  qualifying finding"; name the provably affected code; P0–P3 priorities plus a numeric confidence;
  repository-rule attribution from `AGENTS.md`. (in Matt's Notes e6 as LAB_PROMPTS.md)
- **Greptile, "How to make LLMs shut up"** [blog](https://www.greptile.com/blog/make-llms-shut-up):
  prompting and LLM-as-judge failed to cut nits; filtering new comments by embedding similarity to
  ≥3 downvoted past comments raised address rate 19% → 55%+ in two weeks. (in Matt's docs)
- **Greptile, "Models are worse at reviewing their own code"** [blog](https://www.greptile.com/blog/model-inversion):
  GPT reviewers search depth-first and post fewer comments; Opus posts ~7–8. Matt's data
  contradicts the "use the other vendor" conclusion on severity (Opus 10–15% blocking recall). (in Matt's docs)
- **Uber uReview** [blog](https://www.uber.com/us/en/blog/ureview/): confidence thresholds per
  assistant, language and comment category; semantic-similarity merge; category suppression;
  75% marked useful, 65%+ addressed. (in Matt's docs)
- **BitsAI-CR (ByteDance, FSE 2025)** [arXiv 2501.15134](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15134): a separate
  ReviewFilter raised precision (ablation 54.5% → 67.1%); "Conclusion-First" filter output gave the
  best precision at Direct-Conclusion speed; **Outdated Rate** (share of flagged lines changed
  later) as an automatic acceptance metric: 26.7% vs a human-review baseline of 35–46%.
- **Automated Code Review in Practice (Beko, Qodo PR-Agent)** [arXiv 2412.18531](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18531):
  73.8% of bot comments labelled resolved, but mean PR closure time rose from 5h52 to 8h20 and
  re-reviews after each fix became "redundant and unhelpful". Older model (GPT-4); one company. ⚠️

### 2.4 Benchmarks and eval method

- **GitHub ReviewBench** [blog](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/reviewbench-an-open-benchmark-for-ai-code-review/),
  [repo](https://github.com/review-bench/ReviewBench) (2026-10-05, MIT): 219 PRs, 19 languages, pooled
  gold (humans, LLMs, static analysis), grounded/augmented precision and recall, a 25-task offline test
  set and a judging CLI. Vendor-run; gold mostly machine-made (Report). (in Matt's docs)
- **CR-Bench-v2** [arXiv 2611.02566](https://arxiv.org/abs/2611.02566)
  ([v2 HTML](https://arxiv.org/html/2611.02566v2); Pereira, Sinha, Ghosh, Dutta, Nutanix;
  submitted 2026-11-02, v2 2026-11-03; opened in the 2026-11-04 daily sweep and again on
  2026-11-05): defect-centric benchmark recasting SWE-Bench issues as PR review tasks with full repo
  context. CR-Bench: 584 instances; CR-Bench-Verified: 174 instances from SWE-Bench Verified
  (after detectability + single-PR filters). Each instance: PR + known defect + ground-truth fix
  + taxonomy (category / impact / severity). Metrics: Known-Defect Detection Rate (KDDR) = whether
  the agent hits the labeled defect; Usefulness Rate = fraction of comments that are Bug Hit or
  Valid Suggestion (actionable). Evaluated eight agents over four backbones + Gemini Code Assist;
  three independent LLM judges. Strongest systems: KDDR ≈ 33% on CR-Bench-Verified. Gemini Code
  Assist: KDDR 8.1% but Usefulness Rate 78.0% — usefulness alone misleads. Self-reflection
  (Reflexion) raised KDDR vs single-shot for every backbone (e.g. GPT-5-mini +6.9 to +12.6 pp
  depending on judge; often significant). ⚠️ Python / SWE-Bench scope (Django heavy in the verified
  set); one labeled defect per instance; LLM-generated reference comments and taxonomy (Claude
  Opus 4.5); eval harnesses in the paper are mostly non-tool/non-execution; absolute judge scores
  disagree even when direction agrees. Not in Matt's 2026-10-31 docs.
- **Martian Code Review Bench** [repo](https://github.com/withmartian/code-review-benchmark): 50 PRs /
  173 golden comments offline plus an online set scored against developers' post-review fixes;
  three judge models. (in Matt's docs)

  production misses that needed running code. ⚠️ Python-only, single paper, baselines'
  configuration unknown.

### 2.6 Runtime facts for a Claude Code + Codex skill [doc]

- Claude Code ships a bundled `/code-review` skill (alias `/review`) that runs as a forked
  subagent, reads `CLAUDE.md` (not `REVIEW.md`), widens scope (reuse, simplification, efficiency) depending
  on model and effort level, and caps findings (32 when reporting through
  the findings tool; `--max-findings`) ([local review docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/code-review-local.md)).
- **Ultrareview** (research preview) [docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/ultrareview.md),
  [Escalate to ultrareview](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/code-review-local.md): `/code-review ultra`
  (alias `/ultrareview`) runs a fleet of reviewer agents in a cloud sandbox on Anthropic's
  infrastructure; per the docs, "every reported finding is independently reproduced and verified".
  Scriptable: `claude ultrareview [base]` blocks until done and prints findings to stdout; `--json`
  prints the raw `bugs.json` payload; progress goes to stderr; `--trust-workspace` for CI. Duration
  roughly 5–10 minutes (docs table). Cost: a few free runs per account, then roughly $5–$25 per
  review in usage credits. Requires claude.ai login; not available on Bedrock/Vertex-equivalent/Foundry,
  ZDR, HIPAA, CMEK. Behaviour and pricing may change. No published recall or precision (vendor
  claim only). The useful evidence is the reproduce-before-report design: it is a vendor bet the
  other way from the rejected reproduce-or-drop filter (execution used as a filter cut recall;
  probe+setup −9.2 judged, §1.2), and it is not evidence against that rejection. It is not an arm
  to run. See [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) Rejected, "Claude Code ultrareview as an eval baseline arm".
- **A local skill with the same name replaces a built-in command** in a terminal session
  ([skills docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills.md), "Same name in" table). A standalone copy
  of a skill named `code-review` would shadow the bundled one; the plugin namespace
  (`/accelerate:…`) avoids that.
- Claude Code skill frontmatter supports `effort`, `model`, `context: fork` (run in a subagent with its
  own context), `agent`, `allowed-tools`, `disable-model-invocation` (same page).
- Codex loads skills from `.agents/skills` (repo, walking up to the root) and `~/.agents/skills`;
  `SKILL.md` needs `name` and `description`; optional `agents/openai.yaml` sets UI metadata and
  `allow_implicit_invocation`; plugins distribute skills ([Codex build-skills](https://learn.chatgpt.com/docs/build-skills.md)).
  Matt's orchestrator runs Codex reviews as `codex exec -m <model> -c model_reasoning_effort=high` (Notes).
- Not verified: whether Codex exposes a parallel-subagent primitive to skills. Treat "two independent
  samples" in Codex as two `codex exec` processes until checked.

### 2.7 Same-agent review and unstated bugs

- **Foresight-SWE**, *Do Coding Agents Catch Their Own Bugs? (They Don't.)*
  [arXiv 2611.01181](https://arxiv.org/abs/2611.01181) (opened 2026-11-05; submitted 2026-10-31;
  missed prior sweeps): on 212 real PR₁→PR₂ pairs, agents ~60.7% resolve on the stated task but
  only ~14.8% foresight resolve rate (FRR); when the later defect is named they resolve ~91%.
  Proactive prompting and native self-review (`/self-review`, `/review`) can raise FRR but often
  cut original-task resolve. Popular code-review skills do not raise FRR. Not in Matt's 2026-10-31
  docs. Distinct from "gold comes from a procedure" (§1.2): that procedure builds eval gold; this
  measures whether the author agent, reviewing itself, catches a later bug it was not told about.

## 3. Genuinely new relative to Matt's docs ("candidates for limitless too")

Short list; most external evidence is already in Matt's docs.

1. **Name collision with Claude Code's bundled `/code-review`** (skills docs). Matters for accelerate
   and for any limitless skill shipped to Claude Code users.
2. **Claude Code Review's "Pre-existing" severity** (🟣) as a separate, non-blocking channel for bugs
   the PR didn't introduce — a ready-made home for the Rubric's Q3 "gap already in main" cases that
   aren't explicitly requested.
3. **BitsAI-CR's Outdated Rate** as a zero-cost online proxy (flagged lines later modified), and its
   Conclusion-First verifier format (precision 77.1% vs 65.8% reasoning-first at 1.7 s vs 31 s per
   sample). A possible production KPI next to "orchestrator round-1 findings per PR". ⚠️ fine-tuned models.
4. **Beko's cost side:** PR closure time +42% and redundant re-reviews after each fix — evidence for
   Limitless's later-round scoping and for accelerate to review only the fix diff on re-runs. ⚠️
5. **ReviewBench's 25-task offline test set + judging CLI** as a cheap external smoke check for a
   general-purpose skill (Matt's Report proposes the 60–80 TS/JS slice; the 25-task set is cheaper).
6. **Codex `agents/openai.yaml` `allow_implicit_invocation: false`** to keep a heavy review skill
   from auto-triggering.
7. **CR-Bench-v2** (§2.4) [arXiv 2611.02566](https://arxiv.org/abs/2611.02566): external
   defect-centric bench (CR-Bench-Verified: 174) that scores known-defect detection separately from
   usefulness. Gemini Code Assist is KDDR 8.1% at Usefulness Rate 78.0%, so usefulness alone
   misleads. Candidate for limitless too. ⚠️ Python / SWE-Bench, one labeled defect, LLM judges.
8. **Foresight-SWE** (§2.7) [arXiv]: stated-task resolve and foresight resolve rate are different
   outcomes; native self-review can raise foresight while cutting the original task. Candidate for
   limitless too.

Claude Code ultrareview (§2.6) is not a candidate on this list. Running it as an eval baseline was
rejected on cost; see [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) Rejected, "Claude Code ultrareview as an eval baseline arm".

## 4. Not verified / flagged

- Matt's `research/08` cites "Mitropoulos, Spinellis et al., *Contextual Bias in LLM-Assisted Security
  Code Review*, arXiv 2603.18740". That ID opens as *When AI Agrees Too Much: Manipulating Automated
  Code Review via Bias Injection*. Same topic, different title; worth a check.
- Matt's Report links ReviewBench's blog as `github.blog/ai-and-ml/reviewbench-…`; the URL I could
  open is `github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/reviewbench-…`.
- I did not open the full text of every arXiv paper; for §2.5 I verified that each page exists and
  matches the title Matt's docs cite, and rely on Matt's Report for the specific numbers.
- `human-review/SKILL.md`'s "one in five" statistic: source not found (§0).
